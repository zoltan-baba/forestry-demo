So this is a three-step plan, just in keywords.

Before any work is done: documentation process agreement. When are writers notified about features, changes, etc.?
Who decides what gets documented?


1. Immediate rewrite (high priority Trello cards)

   * reworking topic content
   * editorial review
   * fixing screenshots
   * adding important but as of yet undocumented features (see blog posts)
   * troubleshooting and FAQ needs to be expanded

2. New tool/CMS

   * testing/demos in parallel with the rewriting task
   * picking one
   * implementation

3. New structure and new content

   * reworking the documentation structure
   * creating an information model
   * unifying style and format - this includes matching the devcenter with the new website design


Additional issues to think about:

* API docs layout - right now itâ€™s not user friendly at all
* style guide, guide to documentation - the former is internal of course. Guide to documentation may or may not be necessary.
* how to fit automatically generated content (for example, API docs) to this
